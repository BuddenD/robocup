    @brief Declaration of base Job class.
 
    @class Job
    @brief A base class to encapsulate jobs issued by behaviour.
 
    All jobs need to inherit from this base class. You need only implement a constructor,
    or have a private constructor and provide static functions to create the instances.
    Unfortunately, you need to add the job_id to the job_id_t enum here!

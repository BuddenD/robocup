    @class Job
    @brief A base class to encapsulate jobs issued by behaviour.
 
    All jobs need to inherit from this base class. 

    So I need to add jobs to the job list. All of the jobs have different data members
    I would like to keep it as simple as possible, but also avoid each end having to know
    any sort of order. I could have a structure for each type.
 
    I have tried to have many Job inherit from a base job class. This did not work too well,
    because the data for each job is so different.
 
 Option 1. I could redo it with inheritance but assume that I am allowed to cast the job pointer
           to be of the right type. I am not sure that doing inheritance based on the job type is so greate
           because even within the same job type the data is pretty different. So if I was going to use inheritance
           I would need to have a class for each of the 50 odd jobs. That is a LOT of classes. 
 
           Some of them are pretty similar: All of the camera jobs are the same. All of the light jobs are the same. All of the sound jobs are the same.
           All of the system jobs are the same. So only VISION, LOCALISATION, BEHAVIOUR and MOTION have jobs with vastly different input data.
 
           Alright just cast the motherfuckers so that you can get the right data!

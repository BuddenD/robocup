    @class BodyJob
    @brief A class to encapsulate jobs issued by behaviour to control the body of a robot. 
    These are walk-action macros.
 
    There are five types of body jobs:
        - Stand; request motion to make the robot stand at a given position
        - Walk; request motion to move at given speed
        - Kick; request motion kick a given point toward a given target
        - Block; request motion to block a given point *without* using your hands
        - Save; request motion to block a given point potentially using your hands
 
    Which function should I use?
        - If you need to precisely control the robot's path, for example, you are working your way through
        obstacles, then use a WalkJob.
        - If you want to kick a ball always use a KickJob
        - If you want to block the ball use the SaveJob if you are a goalie inside your box
        - If you want to block the ball use the BlockJob if you are outside your penaly box, or a fieldplayer
        - If you just want to tell the robot to stand at a position, for example, in ready state use a StandJob.
          This function will do some path planning itself to get to the point at *exactly* the given time

    @brief Declaration and definition of the StreamFileReader template class

    @class StreamFileReader
    @brief Class used to read timestamped data from a stream file.

    The stream file reader is used to access time-stamped data stored within a stream file.
    Because of the nature of a stream the file is parsed and each timestamped data objects
    timestamp and location within the file is indexed allowing fast, random access of the
    stream file.
    When reading in the data it is locally buffered and a pointer to the object type read
    is returned.
    Because it is a templated class, any timestamped data can be read from a stream file
    containing it. However any class used in the template must implement the abstract class
    TimestampedData found in the /Tools/FileFormats/ directory so as to access timestamps.

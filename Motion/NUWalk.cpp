/*! @brief Walk to the given point by the given time
 
    Use this function to make use of the internal path planning algorithms. These algorithms are purely time-based and
    consequently they will try to get to the given point as fast as possible.
    To instruct the robot to move as fast as possible, just put in a small time value, the speed will be clipped internally.
    To instruct the robot to stop specify all coordinates to be zero. Alternatively, the robot will stop if no
    walk command has been issued in the last second.
 
    @warning Don't think that you can use this function to queue up points to walk to, or
             even that you can just call this function once and expect the robot to magically
             walk to the point. You need to call this function at every behaviour iteration with new
             data so that localisation feedback is used to walk to the point.
 
    @param time the desired time to reach the given point (ms)
    @param x the desired relative target [x (cm), y (cm), theta (rad)]

    @brief Implementation of motion class

    @author Jason Kulk
 
 So what can Motion do?
    - walk
    - track points, pan, nod with the head
    - do kicks
    - play scripts (get-ups, and probably blocks)
 
 So that looks like four sub modules.
 
 NUMotion gets some jobs; BODY and HEAD. Now I need to convert those jobs into
 other jobs, or put the actions in the NUActionatorsData
 
 WALK.
    Input:
        NUSensorsData
        Current walk-related job
    Output:
        NUActionatorsData
 
 HEAD.
    Input: 
        NUSensorsData (I think that you should proably try to stablise the head, and maybe use some smarter control)
        Current head-related job
    Output:
        NUActionatorsData
 
 KICK.
    Input:
        NUSensorsData (The kick should be closed loop)
        Current kick-related job
    Output:
        NUActionatorsData
 
 BLOCK.
 
 SAVE.
 
 GETUP.

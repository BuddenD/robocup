    @brief Declaration of a single actionator class

    @class actionator_t
    @brief A container for a single actionator, for example a single LED, or a single Joint.

    You can make groups of related actionators by using vectors, lists etc. In fact, the JointActionators
    are merely a vector of actionator_t's.

    actionator_t is a template class. It is a template so that we can have an actionator_t for several types;
    a joint requires the data to be a float, while the sound requires the data to be a string.
